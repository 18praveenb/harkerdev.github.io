{"name":"Harker Development","tagline":"Useful utilities for harker students","body":"### Welcome to Harker Development's Main Directory.\r\nWe're a student-run organization dedicated to developing projects to make Upper School student life easier. A few of our popular projects include [the bell schedule web application](http://www.github.com/harkerdev/bellschedule) and [changes to PCR coloring](http://www.github.com/harkerdev/pcrchanges). \r\n\r\n### How to Contribute\r\n\r\nFirst, go to the repository (located at https://www.github.com/harkerdev/<repository name>)\r\n\r\n#### TL;DR\r\n1. **Check the To Do Section**: choose a pending task that hasn't yet been completed from the issues page and help us add that functionality to the schedule\r\n2. **Fork this Repository**: fork either the main or development branches to your account\r\n3. **Make the Changes**: make proposed changes on your fork\r\n4. **Submit a Pull Request**: submit a pull request, then we'll review the changes and accept them if applicable\r\n\r\n#### Detailed Guide\r\n\r\n1. **Fork project** (click upper right \"Fork\" button)\r\n2. **Goto your fork**, (lower right, SSH clone url)\r\n![git clone url](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/928812/2546957/26d189f6-b646-11e3-80e5-3659c5e1ed43.png)\r\n3. Open a Terminal. \"**git clone**\" a local copy off your own fork.\r\n```git clone git@github.com:harkerdev/bellschedule.git```\r\n4. **Create a branch**. You can call it anything, for example \"fix timer\".\r\n```git checkout -b fix_timer```\r\n5. Make your changes to the file(s) in your newly created branch.\r\n6. **Commit** your changes. ```git commit -a```\r\n7. **Push your branch** to your github repo (which is a fork of HarkerDev/bellschedule).\r\n```git push origin fix_timer```\r\n8. Browse to your github repo and click on the green \"**Compare & pull request**\"\r\n9. After your pull request is accepted you can **delete your branch**. (A grey button will show up in the closed PR. You can get to it from your Github notifications).\r\n\r\nIf you mess up, you can delete your branch on Github.\r\n```git push origin :fix_timer```\r\nThen on your local repo, in that same fix_timer branch, you can make your new changes and do a ```git commit --amend``` when you are done.\r\nThen finish with Steps 7 and 8.\r\n\r\nTo keep the master branch of your Github fork (and your local master branch as well) up to date with HarkerDev/bellschedule, do the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit remote add HarkerDev https://github.com/HarkerDev/bellschedule.git\r\ngit checkout master\r\ngit pull HarkerDev master\r\ngit push origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo let's assume I had done a clone of `HarkerDev/bellschedule` a couple weeks ago but since then, there had been changes committed to the master branch. Because of this, both my local repository as well as **my** Github fork of `HarkerDev/bellschedule` are both lagging behind by a number of commits. Let's catch up (fast-forward) to where the latest commit of `HarkerDev/bellschedule` is **before** we apply our own changes.\r\n\r\n`cd bellschedule` (go to your local repo)\r\n\r\n`git checkout master` (make sure you are on master branch)\r\n\r\n`git pull HarkerDev master` (pull changes from vhf and merge them to your local repo)\r\n\r\n`git push origin master` (push our now updated local repo to your github fork so that it is updated as well)\r\n\r\nNow that you are completely up to date, you can jump to Step 4 (above). If these steps aren't taken, then Manan Shah (@mananshah99) may run into merge conflicts when trying to add your contribution (not as easy as a one click merge, when there's no conflicts).\r\n\r\nIf you're using the GitHub for Mac, simply sync your repository and you'll see the new branch.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n* [Brian Chan](http://github.com/iluvredwall)\r\n* [Manan Shah](http://github.com/mananshah99)\r\n* [Andrew Tierno](http://github.com/andrew-tierno)\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble?
